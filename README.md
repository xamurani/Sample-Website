# Sample Website

A simple, responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features multiple sections including a home page, an about section, a services section, and a contact form. The project demonstrates basic front-end web development techniques.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Allows users to easily navigate between different sections.
- **Home Section**: Welcome message and introductory content.
- **About Section**: Information about the website or company.
- **Services Section**: Displays services offered with short descriptions.
- **Contact Form**: Users can send a message through a form, with basic client-side validation.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for the website.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity, including a simple contact form validation.

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xamurani/sample-website.git
   cd sample-website

2. **Open the index.html file** in your preferred web browser to view the website.

3. **Edit the files:**

- Modify the HTML content in index.html to update the structure and content.
- Edit styles.css for design changes and to customize the appearance.
- Update scripts.js for any additional interactivity or form validation logic.

**Contact Form**
The contact form uses basic JavaScript to validate whether all fields are filled before submission. If all fields are complete, the form will display a confirmation message. Otherwise, it will prompt the user to fill in all the fields.

**How the Form Works**
- **Name:** A text input field for the user’s name.
- **Email:** A text input field for the user’s email address.
- **Message:** A textarea for the user to enter a message.
- **Submit Button:** When clicked, the form validates the input and shows a confirmation alert if everything is filled in.

**Future Improvements**
- **Backend Integration:** The contact form is not currently connected to a backend to actually send emails or store messages. Implementing a backend API to handle form submissions would be a great next step.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Adding ARIA attributes and improving keyboard navigation for accessibility.
- **Responsive Design:** Further improvements for better mobile responsiveness.
